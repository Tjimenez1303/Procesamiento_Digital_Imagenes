# Procesamiento_Digital_Imagenes
In this repository we will apply different morphological operations to images. In addition, we will find basic concepts about the programming used in machine learning about the identification of objects or faces. We will find algorithms for filters of rigid and non-rigid transformations. Everything in a point-by-point way


## Module 1:

* [1_Conceptos_básicos_de_imágenes](https://github.com/Tjimenez1303/Procesamiento_Digital_Imagenes/blob/main/1_Conceptos_b%C3%A1sicos_de_im%C3%A1genes.ipynb) : In this notebook we will see some basic concepts for the management of images such as: reading, conversion, plotting and histogram of an image.

 * [2_Operaciones Morfológicas](https://github.com/Tjimenez1303/Procesamiento_Digital_Imagenes/blob/main/2_Operaciones_Morfol%C3%B3gicas.ipynb) : In this notebook we will see the four types of morphological operations: erosion, dilation, opening and closing. In addition, we will see some useful examples where this type of operations can be applied. All this with a step-by-step explanation.
 
 * [3_Filtros Parte 1](https://github.com/Tjimenez1303/Procesamiento_Digital_Imagenes/blob/main/3_Filtros_Parte_1.ipynb) : In this notebook we will start by seeing that it is a gradient, both in X and Y, to later apply different types of filters to images, both with a library and making them manually.
 
 * [4_Filtros Parte 2](https://github.com/Tjimenez1303/Procesamiento_Digital_Imagenes/blob/main/4_Filtros_Parte_2.ipynb) : In this notebook we will see some other concepts of image filters such as: the Gaussian Kernel and convolution in the domain of time and frequency. In addition, we will see other types of filters such as HPF, LPF, BPF and stop band.
