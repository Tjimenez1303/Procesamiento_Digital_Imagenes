# Procesamiento_Digital_Imagenes
In this repository we will apply different morphological operations to images. In addition, we will find basic concepts about the programming used in machine learning about the identification of objects or faces. We will find algorithms for filters of rigid and non-rigid transformations. Everything in a point-by-point way

## Workshops:

* [1_Workshop_1_DIP](https://github.com/Tjimenez1303/Procesamiento_Digital_Imagenes/blob/main/Working/1_Workshop_1_DIP.ipynb) : In this notebook we will apply the respective morphological filters to filter different colors of an image with candies of different candies. In addition, each of the filters will be built by hand, that is, without the use of specialized libraries on this subject.

* [2_Workshop_2_Clasificador_imagenes_prenda-genero](https://github.com/Tjimenez1303/Procesamiento_Digital_Imagenes/blob/main/Working/2_Workshop_2_Clasificador_imagenes_prenda-genero.ipynb) : STILL IN PROCESS. In this notebook we will build two types of neural network architectures, for the first one a sequential architecture is built and, on the other hand, a functional architecture. The goal of both is to identify a piece of clothing and decide if it is for men or women.

## Module 1:

* [1_Conceptos_b치sicos_de_im치genes](https://github.com/Tjimenez1303/Procesamiento_Digital_Imagenes/blob/main/Module_1/1_Conceptos_b%C3%A1sicos_de_im%C3%A1genes.ipynb) : In this notebook we will see some basic concepts for the management of images such as: reading, conversion, plotting and histogram of an image.

 * [2_Operaciones Morfol칩gicas](https://github.com/Tjimenez1303/Procesamiento_Digital_Imagenes/blob/main/Module_1/2_Operaciones_Morfol%C3%B3gicas.ipynb) : In this notebook we will see the four types of morphological operations: erosion, dilation, opening and closing. In addition, we will see some useful examples where this type of operations can be applied. All this with a step-by-step explanation.
 
 * [3_Filtros Parte 1](https://github.com/Tjimenez1303/Procesamiento_Digital_Imagenes/blob/main/Module_1/3_Filtros_Parte_1.ipynb) : In this notebook we will start by seeing that it is a gradient, both in X and Y, to later apply different types of filters to images, both with a library and making them manually.
 
 * [4_Filtros Parte 2](https://github.com/Tjimenez1303/Procesamiento_Digital_Imagenes/blob/main/Module_1/4_Filtros_Parte_2.ipynb) : In this notebook we will see some other concepts of image filters such as: the Gaussian Kernel and convolution in the domain of time and frequency. In addition, we will see other types of filters such as HPF, LPF, BPF and stop band.
   
## Module 2: 

* [1_Introducci칩n_ANN](https://github.com/Tjimenez1303/Procesamiento_Digital_Imagenes/blob/main/Module_2/1_Introducci%C3%B3n_ANN.ipynb) : In this notebook we will look at the basics (along with their demonstrations) of a basic neural network. Such as: regularization, activation functions and some models such as classification and perceptron.
  
* [2_Function_of_the_kernel_in_a_CNN](https://github.com/Tjimenez1303/Procesamiento_Digital_Imagenes/blob/main/Module_2/2_Function_of_the_kernel_in_a_CNN.ipynb) : In this notebook we will see how the Kernel of an image works, applying different types of Kernel depending on the needs.

* [3_My_first_CNN](https://github.com/Tjimenez1303/Procesamiento_Digital_Imagenes/blob/main/Module_2/3_My_first_CNN.ipynb) : In this notebook we will build the first neural network, using a toy database of garments from the Sickit-Learn library. Each of the steps to construct a classifier will be applied.
